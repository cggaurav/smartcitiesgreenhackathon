                    <h3> Why </h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the world, including both developing and
                        developed countries, air, noise & light pollution has a negative
                        impact on health and environment. However, there is still a lack of
                        scientific data and this impacts on expanding public
                        understanding and awareness of this issue.

                                <li> <strong> Air </strong> - measure smoke, CO2, alcohol, dust and allergic compounds </li>
                                <li> <strong> Sound </strong>  - measure and analyze sounds from rail, air, construction etc </li>
                                <li> <strong> Temperature and Humidity </strong></li>
                                <li> <strong> Light </strong> - what if it was too bright in the evening or too dark in the morning?</li>
